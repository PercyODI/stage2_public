# Week Two

Dear *\<INSERT NAME HERE>*,

Thank you for all your work during week one! Now that we have some structure on the first page of the new GrillBer application, we think it's time for styling! Luckily, you should have been able to watch all the CSS videos put on by *\<R&D Specialist Name>*, and are ready to start applying some styles to the page!

But hold on there! Before we get in too far, our friends at our sister company EduTec* have put together an interactive CSS practice tool that we believe will help take your CSS selection skills to the next level! Also, we have decided it is mandatory.

---

## Step One

Before moving forward, we must ask you to go to [EduTec CSS Diner Exercise](https://flukeout.github.io/)* and complete *at least* the first 21 exercises. If time permits, feel free to move on and complete all 32!

## Step Two

Be sure you have watched all the CSS videos!

## Step Three

Ok, now we are ready to get back to work on GrillBer! Follow the requirements below, and remember that the feature isn't complete until it is published to GitHub Pages!

### Requirements

***WARNING #1:*** While doing research for the following requirements, you will run across several answers, solutions, and posts that reference something call Bootstrap, or jQuery. You are **not** allowed to install Bootstrap to complete these requirements, nor can you use scripts, jQuery, or the `$()` you might see in several answers!

***WARNING #2:*** The Quality Assurance team has set department standards to never use inline style attributes. You are not allowed to use inline style attributes to set CSS styles, and any previous inline style attributes must be converted to the style element or removed.

Example of an inline style element:

> \<p style="color: blue;">Lorem Ipsum</p>

For our second feature, we need the following requirements satisfied:

1. An HTML file with style tag available to the public through GitHub pages
1. Colors!
    - GrillTec has not decided on the color scheme they want to go with yet. But never fear! We don't want to leave you to your own devices!
    - You must visit [ColorMind](http://colormind.io/bootstrap/). You can click Generate as many times as you want, but you once you pick a scheme you must stick with it!
    - Under each color is the hex value you can use in the CSS
    - Choosing wisely from the generated color scheme, color everything in the Application
1. Quality Control has asked that we replace all instances of the following elements with CSS with some wrapper tag and CSS:
    - \<strong>
    - \<b>
    - \<em>
    - \<u>
    - \<i>
1. Text needs to be at-least 22px so that it isn't too small.
    - This might affect the headers. You may have to update them appropriately!
1. The top, including the title "GrillBer", must:
    - Have a background-color that separates it from the rest of the page
    - This coloring must touch the top and sides of the page
    - The text must be anywhere but the left! 
1. The content of the page must only take up the middle 80% of the page. Nothing but the top title can be within 20% of the side of the page.
1. All header elements must be centered over their content
1. The fake table of grill rental data must use the following guidelines:
    - The head background must be of a different color the the data rows
    - The head must have italic text
    - The table rows must be zebra striped (alternating light and dark backgrounds)
        - You still have to use the generated color scheme, but no one said you couldn't alter the alpha of the color
    - Any numbers in the table must be underlined and centered in their cell
    - Extra Credit: Make all the numbers after a period in currency be superset (smaller and above the center line of the text)
1. Each question and answer in the FAQ section should be wrapped in a border with a round corner. 
1. The FAQ section and the How and Why section should be positioned side by side.
