## Week Two/Three

Dear *\<INSERT NAME HERE>*,

Everyone at the head office is just so pleased with all the work on GrillBer. They recently told shareholders that GrillBer is the `Big Data Silicon Valley Apple Block-Chain` of the Grill-based Technology ecosystem. No pressure.

You are making great headway, but there is still so much to do! Marketing is out doing market research analysis, HR is ramping up the recruiting process, and R&D is, well, frankly they do what they want.

There is so much that we can't keep track of it all! Good thing we have a crack team of developer geniuses at the GrillBer branch. We've tasked them with putting together a To-Do application for us to use and keep track of everything. You can expect to see something come out of there soon!

Oh, right. You are the GrillBer branch. Well, you better get started on that To-Do application. A lot of people are depending on it. And don't forget that trademark GrillTec flair!

## Step Two

There are a lot of things happening at GrillBer, and your work is really pushing us over and above our expectations! In fact, there is so much we want to do that we need a page that we can keep all of our to-dos!

We would like you to build a to-do app in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! It needs to do the following things:

1. Allow users to input a new to-do item
1. Allow users to complete an incomplete to-do item
1. Allow users to un-complete a completed to-do item
1. Allow users to delete any to-do item
1. Allow users to create a new user 
1. Allow users to assign and reassign users to a to-do item
1. All actions should be done through the API, so changes are persisted.
1. Show the list of items left to do
1. Show the list of items that have been completed
    - Make it clear they are completed, such as a strike-through or red!
1. Make it look good!
    - Make good color choices
    - Soften the corners so things aren't too sharp
1. Make it feel interactive! 
    - items should change when you hover over them!
1. Give it a GrillTec inspired name. Marketing is out doing research and aren't available to name this product!
1. Make sure the application is up and running on GitHub Pages!
