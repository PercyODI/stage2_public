## Week Two/Three

Dear *\<INSERT NAME HERE>*,

Everyone at the head office is just so pleased with all the work on GrillBer. They recently told shareholders that GrillBer is the `Big Data Silicon Valley Apple Block-Chain` of the Grill-based Technology ecosystem. No pressure.

You are making great headway, but there is still so much to do! Marketing is out doing market research analysis, HR is ramping up the recruiting process, and R&D is, well, frankly they do what they want.

There is so much that we can't keep track of it all! Good thing we have a crack team of developer geniuses at the GrillBer branch. We've tasked them with putting together a To-Do application for us to use and keep track of everything. You can expect to see something come out of there soon!

Oh, right. You are the GrillBer branch. Well, you better get started on that To-Do application. A lot of people are depending on it. And don't forget that trademark GrillTec flair!
