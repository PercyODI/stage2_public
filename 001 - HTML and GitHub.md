# Welcome

Dear *\<INSERT NAME HERE>*,

Hello, and welcome to ***GrillTec INC***, the most advanced grill-based technology company in America! We pride ourselves on delivering top-quality software, and are so happy that you have joined us as a full-stack software developer!

You and your team have been tasked with developing a new app idea coming straight from R&D: GrillBer! I know, you are just as excited as we are! 

You will be provided with the instructional videos created by our in-house R&D specialist *\<R&D Specialist Name>* as he was developing a side project call RealTimeDiary. Unfortunately this project had to be scrapped due to copyright infringement and its lack of grill-based opportunities.

## What is GrillBer?

GrillBer is exactly like it sounds: Uber for grills! Let me set the scene. You live in a dense urban environment, in a studio apartment on the 20th floor of an apartment building, but you want to put on a cookout! You don't have the space or the budget to buy a high quality grill, but your local park doesn't provide public access grills for your cookout. What do you do?

That's where GrillBer comes in! GrillBer is a rental and delivery service for grills! Grill renters can put up the specs and descriptions for their grills, and users can rent them for specific amounts of time! The grill owner will drop off the grill at the designated time and location, and then pick it back up when the user is finished!

Just think of the possibilities! 

## What do we need **now**?

Because we are a completely agile tech shop, we believe in small, incremental development. Each week we will specify what requirements we need to be delivered. And to keep the feedback loop as short as possible, we want the code out in the world as soon as each feature is delivered!

## Requirements
For our first feature, we need the following requirements satisfied:

1. An HTML file available to the public through GitHub pages
1. A header with the name of our application: GrillBer
1. A paragraph with a description of our application.
1. A fake table of grill rental data. At a minimum, the table must contain the following data points:
    - Brand and model of grill
    - Username of the grill renter
    - City this grill is located
    - Cost per hour
    - Delivery cost
    - Grill rating (1 to 5)
1. At least five entries in the fake table
1. Two more sections, started with the next size down header
    - FAQ section with at least 3 questions and their answers (each question should be yet another size down header)
    - How and why section for potential grill renters
1. Use at least two more HTML tags that were not used in the previous requirements. Might I suggest the hr tag?
