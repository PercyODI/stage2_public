## Week 003A

Dear *\<INSERT NAME HERE>*,

Everyone is loving the webpage design you came up with last week! It has been referred to as GeoCities-esque, which apparently is retro and in at the moment. But we'll see how long that lasts!

We have a pressing issue, however. As our agile shop is growing, we are having a harder and harder time deciding how pairs should be assigned each day. We need some application to set up this application for us, and we will provide it to all the teams!

## Requirements

1. HTML, CSS, and Javascript application available on GitHub pages
1. Users can enter names into an input box, and they are added to a list below the input box
1. Users can click a button that will randomly create pairs based on the list of names added
1. Picked pairs are displayed under the list of entered names
    - The pairs must be clearly defined (`"Andrew and Kayla"`, or maybe borders or some such)
1. If the number of users is odd, a random pair group becomes a tri-pair (has three members instead of two)
1. Make it look good
    - CSS to help make the app work and be user friendly

### Extra Credit

1. Validate user input
    - Don't allow blank names
    - Don't allow duplicate names
1. Users can remove a name from the list of added names
1. Only show/enable sections and buttons if they are valid
    - If no names have been entered, don't show the pick pairs button!
1. Make inputting the name work on pressing enter
